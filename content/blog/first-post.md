First, DNA is packed around histone proteins, forming nucleosomes that organize into chromatin. The structure of chromatin can be either open (accessible) or closed (repressive), depending on chemical modifications to histones and DNA.

Histone modifications help regulate chromatin accessibility:

H3K27ac (acetylation at lysine 27 of histone H3) is a mark of active enhancers and promoters; it is associated with open chromatin.
H3K4me3 (trimethylation at lysine 4 of histone H3) marks active promoters.

When chromatin is in an open state, transcription factors bind to specific DNA sequences at enhancers and promoters. Enhancers, often located far from the gene they regulate, help activate promoters by facilitating DNA looping that brings the enhancer close to the promoter. This interaction is supported by cofactors such as Mediator and cohesin.
At the promoter (which may or may not contain a TATA box or GC box), general transcription factors and RNA polymerase II assemble to form the pre-initiation complex. Once assembled, RNA polymerase II begins transcription of the gene.
