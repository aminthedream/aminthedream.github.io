abstract: "In this study, we identified cell clusters using a combinatorial approach by integrating our scATAC-seq and HiC datasets and further annotated the clusters using single cell transcriptomic datasets from Tabula Muris project. Our approach identified unique open chromatin topology patterns for each investigated tissue type. The identified patterns and subsequently tissue-specific genomic regions can be used as a baseline to enhance therapeutic strategies toward a more organ-specific approach for targeting the disease or cancer site and having less off-target effect on uninvolved tissues."
