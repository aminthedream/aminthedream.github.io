abstract: "Through differential gene expression analysis, we identified significant patterns of gene expression changes. Pathway analysis revealed enriched biological processes and pathways, consistent with important functional implications of these gene expression changes. Notably, our analysis identified the smooth muscle actin gene ACTA2 as a one of the most profoundly affected gene expression changes. ACTA2 is a component of the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that changes in cytoskeleton organization could play a contributory role in cisplatin resistance. Western blotting and fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) validated the increased expression of ACTA2 protein in cisplatin-resistant cells. We are now conducting experiments to explore the role of ACTA2 in modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer cell lines. These findings will enhance our understanding of gene expression regulation and the role of ACTA2 in ovarian cancer, providing potential therapeutic targets for further investigation and validation."
