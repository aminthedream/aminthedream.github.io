      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a bioinformatician with a strong focus on studying how genes are organized and regulated within cells. My work involves analyzing data from various DNA and RNA experiments to understand genetic functions and structures. I use programming languages like Python and R to build tools that help in analyzing large amounts of genetic data efficiently. I develop and improve bioinformatics pipelines that streamline the process of data analysis, making it more efficient for other scientists to access and interpret their genetic data. My interest in how 3D genome architecture is arranged and how it influences its function, helping uncover new insights that could lead to a better understanding of diseases and their treatments. I have written several research articles and contribute regularly to scientific discussions.
