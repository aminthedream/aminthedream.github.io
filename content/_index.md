        Throughout my research career, I have taken on diverse roles where I have led computational analyses of complex next-generation sequencing data, including types such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, CUT&RUN, ATAC-Seq, and Hi-C at both single-cell and bulk resolutions. I specialize in developing and benchmarking bioinformatics pipelines to process large-scale datasets and implementing reproducible workflows for integrating multi-omics data from various research studies. My goal is to contribute significantly to advancements in the field.
