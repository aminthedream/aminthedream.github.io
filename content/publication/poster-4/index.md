abstract: "We developed and applied a novel HiC-ECC workflow to enhance chromatin interaction data from 15 colorectal cancer organoid models, revealing four distinct 3D genome subtypes linked to tumor heterogeneity and metastatic potential. This approach offers new insights into CRC epigenomics and supports its integration into patient stratification and targeted therapy.."
